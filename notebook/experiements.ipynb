      "Okay, the user is asking for the capital of India. Let me start by recalling what I know. I remember that the capital of India is New Delhi. But wait, I should make sure that's accurate. I think New Delhi is part of the larger city of Delhi, which is the capital territory. Let me verify if there's any confusion between Delhi and New Delhi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delhi was the capital of British India, but after independence, New Delhi was specifically built as the capital of the new nation. So the capital is New Delhi, which is within the National Capital Territory of Delhi. I should also mention that sometimes people might refer to Delhi as the capital, but technically it's New Delhi. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should check if there have been any changes or if there's any recent information. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there hasn't been any change. So the answer remains New Delhi. Additionally, maybe the user is interested in some context, like why it's New Delhi or its significance. Including a brief note about its historical background could be helpful. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if the user is a student or someone preparing for a test, so providing a concise yet comprehensive answer would be best. Avoid any unnecessary details but ensure clarity. Double-checking the facts is important to avoid any mistakes. Yes, the capital is definitely New Delhi, part of the NCT of Delhi. Alright, time to put that together in a clear response.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Key Points:\n",
      "- **Historical Context**: New Delhi was designed in the early 20th century by British architects Edward Lutyens and Herbert Baker as the capital of British India. It became the official capital in 1931 and continued as the capital of independent India after 1947.\n",
      "- **Distinction from Delhi**: While \"Delhi\" often refers to the broader city (Old Delhi, New Delhi, and surrounding areas), **New Delhi** is the specific area designated as the capital. The NCT of Delhi, a federal territory, encompasses both old and new parts of the city.\n",

The changes \\nobserved in Sea Ice Extent (SIE) over the polar reg ions in the recent past are \\nalarming. The present Atlas focuses on the monthly trends observed for the sea \\nice cover at 1˚ x 1˚ grid using QuikSCAT Ku-band sc atterometer data for a \\ndecade (August 1999 - July 2009).  \\nThe interesting outcomes of the study for the Arctic and Antarctic as a whole and \\nfor various smaller geographic regions have been hi ghlighted in the Atlas. \\nNoteworthy observations of the study are  \\n(i) recent decline in summer sea ice extent in the Arct ic is of the order of \\n0.16 M Sq km per year with reference to the average  summer sea ice \\nextent between 1999 to 2008,  \\n(ii) a significant negative trend up to 15% per year in the Chukchi and East \\nSiberian seas in the summer minimum extent of sea i ce cover.  \\nHowever, a negative trend in the winter-maximum is observed in \\nBarents Sea, which is a distinct pattern,  \\n(iii) A drastic increase of 12-months running average SIE  from 2007 to 2008 \\nobserved in both the hemispheres \\n \\nThe results presented in the Atlas are also importa nt considering the seam-\\nless continuity of Ku-band scatterometer data throu gh the India’s Oceansat-2 \\nscatterometer (OSCAT) launched in November 2009. Th e two sensors are \\nquite similar, with only minor differences in frequ ency of operation and \\nincidence angles.'),\n",

In simple words sea ice can be considered as any form of ice that is \\nfound at sea and has originated from the freezing of sea water. One of the most \\nimportant properties of sea ice is that it is less dense than sea water and \\ntherefore it floats over ocean surface.  \\nSea Ice is having a profound effect on the ocean and atmosphere. It \\nmodulates the normal exchange of heat and mass between the atmosphere \\nand the ocean by insulating sea surface from atmosphere.  \\nThe albedo of sea ice is much higher, by a factor of ten, than that of open \\nocean water. This give rise to the ice-albedo feed-back processes (Thomas \\nand Dickmann, 2003), a perturbation in the surface energy balance resulting in \\na decrease in ice extent due to warming may propagate and amplify since the \\nreduction in ice extent in turn increases the amount of solar energy absorbed \\nby the system (Curry et al., 1995).  \\nOne can consider sea ice as a thin blanket covering the ocean surface. This \\nblanket controls the fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum across the ocean-\\natmosphere interface. It is now believed that recent frequent episodes of heavy \\nsnowfall and freezing winters in parts of Europe, such as in 2005, 2009 and \\n2010, can be traced to higher evaporation or heat source, in the form of 0˚ C'),\n",

Hence, such snowfall can be considered as a part of the hydrological \\ncycle.    \\nIn addition, sea ice cover it is also controlled by the ocean-atmosphere \\nforcing. Because of its lower thickness, it is highly vulnerable and even small \\nchange within the ocean-atmosphere is able to introduce significant change in \\nthe thickness and extents of the sea ice.  \\nHence, sea ice affects the atmosphere through lowered rate of evaporation \\nas well as strong ice albedo-feedback mechanism and also affects, ocean \\nthrough the release of brine/fresh water during its growth/melting cycle. Since \\nthe total time duration of the growth and the melting is of the order of one year, \\nthe ice cover effectively integrates the climate signal over this short period and \\nacts as an indicator of climate (Rees, 2005).  \\nThere are various types of sea ice, according to its stage of development. \\nFirst-year Ice is the Sea ice of not more than one winter's growth, developing \\nfrom young ice, with a thickness of 30 cm or greater. The old (multi-year) Ice is \\ndefined as sea ice that has survived at least one summer's melt. Its \\ntopographic features generally are smoother than those of first-year ice. The \\nexamples of sea ice types based on its stages are shown in figure 1.1. \\nHowever, due to the harsh climate and the remoteness of the polar oceans sea \\nice features are among the least understood regions of the planet. The thin \\nsea-ice layer over the ocean surface just accounts for the 0.1% of the Earth’s \\npermanent ice volume but covers the 70% of the ice aerial extent.\"),\n",

The activities received a boost after the launch of Oceansat-1 \\ncarrying the Multi-channel Scanning Microwave Radiometer (MSMR) onboard, \\nin May 1999. Oceansat-1 was placed in a near circular, polar sun-synchronous \\norbit at an altitude of 720 km.

The large scale Antarctic features captured by MSMR were \\ninvestigated and reported by Vyas et al. (2001).

The following points describe the \\nphysics behind this retrieval: \\n/head2right Ocean backscatter at both V and H polarizations are equal at nadir and \\ndecrease with increasing incidence angle and the V-pol backscatter \\nbecomes stronger than H-pol.

The wind direction sensitivity of σO  \\nvaries periodically with angle between the plane of incidence and wind \\ndirection with peak around 60º angle (Sarkar and Kumar, 1985). \\n \\nHence, the key to determining the wind direction and speed from \\nscatterometer is the anisotropic behavior of the surface roughness over \\nocean, since the crests and troughs of the surface wave field tend to align \\nthemselves perpendicularly to the wind direction (Rees, 2006). The \\ncapability of measuring both wind speed and direction is the major \\nuniqueness of the scatterometer.

In the Northern Hemisphere, \\nArctic Polar Region covers the southern limit of terrestrial Tundra, the Arctic \\nOcean and the Sub-arctic Seas and the atmosphere to the north of the region \\nof the Polar Front. The Arctic Ocean is a deep basin centered on the North Pole \\nand surrounded by land and narrow outlets (Berring Strait, Davis Strait, Fram \\nStrait, Norwegian Sea and Greenland Sea etc.) in to the Atlantic and the Pacific \\noceans.  \\nThe ice in the Arctic Ocean can survive for a long time due to the big \\noceanic gyre present in the Arctic Ocean, which will allow ice to grow and \\nincrease in its thickness. Ice will rotate for years due to this gyre until it leaves \\nthe basin through one of the straits/outlets.  \\nIn the Arctic there are two main large scale wind driven drift components. \\nThe first is the Beaufort gyre, a clockwise rotation around the North Pole which \\nresults from an average high pressure system that creates the winds in the \\nregion. The second is the transpolar drift, where ice moves from the Siberian \\ncoast across the Arctic basin to the north coast of Greenland. This allows the \\nflow of ice in to the North Atlantic through the Fram strait between Greenland'),\n",

However, it may be noted that \\nboth the curves follow the same trend/pattern. This shows that the SIE values \\nobtained by the STD algorithm are in close agreement with NSIDC SIE values, \\nbut for a positive bias, which can be explained on the basis of difference in the \\nprocesses recorded by the scatterometers and the PMRs.  \\nThe summer melting in the Arctic will be at its maximum in September \\nmonth. Summer is the time when sea ice breaks into individual ice floes, \\nparticularly in the marginal sea-ice zone, which is also saturated with wet \\nsnow/ice layer due to the ongoing peak summer melting process. The snow \\ncover and the rough edges of the floes provide very high backscatter (σ0) \\nbecause of the strong reflected radar signal back from the surface. This makes \\nthe partially melted sea ice distinguishable from water, more easily.'),\n",

The Antarctic region of the southern ocean is \\nsurrounded by a circumpolar ocean current. Though the atmosphere in \\nthe Antarctic is colder than in the Arctic, the heat flux from the turbulent \\nunprotected sea is much higher. This condition leads to the highly \\nvariable sea-ice cover that is 50% larger than the Antarctic continent in \\nwinter while it almost disappears in the summer. This leads to the \\nprevalence of lower ice thickness and higher ice drift as compared to the \\narctic. \\nAn ice cover of up to 20 M sq km extent girdles the Antarctic continent \\nduring winter (Eicken and Lemke, 2001) . In the summer, patches of \\nperennial ice, covering about 4 M sq km area, remain in the Weddell and \\nBellingshausen/Amundsen/Ross Sea sectors at 0-60˚W and 70-180˚W, \\nrespectively. \\n \\n4.2 Analysis of inter-annual variations \\nThe figure 4.2 shows the average   SIE (figure 4.2a), for the extreme melting \\nyear and one normal year, as well as the average with one SD limits for the'),\n",

The important findings are summarized below. \\ni. It has been observed that the recent decline in summer sea ice extent \\nin the Arctic is of the order of 2.54% (0.16 M Sq km) per year with \\nreference to the average summer sea ice extent between 1999 to \\n2008. For the same period the decline as per Passive Microwave \\nRadiometer (PMR) based NSIDC data is of the order of 3.52 % (0.20 M \\nSq km) per year. However, in the Antarctic, increasing and \\ndecreasing behavior is observed at an interval of 3 to 4 years, with an \\noverall statistically insignificant marginal positive trend. The lower sea \\nice extent obtained from PMR sensors can be explained as discussed \\nbelow in point number (ii). \\nii. Scatterometer is expected to give more accurate sea ice extent \\ninformation in the marginal sea ice zone as compared to passive \\nmicrowave radiometers due to its higher sensitivity to sea surface \\nroughness, which is caused by the melting of ice-floes at the sea ice-\\nwater interface. Also the sensitivity of passive sensors is low in such \\nregions due to very low concentration of sea ice.'),\n",

A drastic increase of 12-months running average SIE from 2007 to \\n2008 can be noticed in both the hemispheres. It is an interesting \\nobservation. Due to this phenomenon the total of bo th the \\nhemispheres is also showing a drastic increase in 2008 from the all \\ntime low of 2007. This is in contrast to the gradual reduction of sea ice \\ncover with small fluctuations in the previous years. \\niv. It is observed that the year-to-year variations are higher during the \\nsummer period as compared to the winter period in both the \\nhemispheres. In case of the Arctic, it is the re-freezing process which \\nis highly variable from year to year in the months of October and \\nNovember. However, in the case of Antarctic it is not the freezing but \\nthe melting process, which is highly variable and takes place from \\nDecember to January.  \\nv. The rate of the melting and the freezing processes in the two \\nhemispheres are also opposite to each other. The melting process in \\nthe Arctic takes seven months whereas refreezing is faster, and takes \\nonly 5 months. In the Antarctic, melting of sea ice is taking much \\nsmaller time (5-months) as compared to refreezing (7-months). The \\nreason for this could be the difference between the geography of the \\ntwo regions. The Arctic is encompassed by land masses with narrow \\nopenings to open oceans, whereas the Antarctic is surrounded by the \\ncircumpolar ocean on the outer side and continental land mass on \\ninner side.'),\n",

The average monthly SIE, at decadal scale, is showing high anti-\\ncorrelation between the two polar regions as expected due to the out \\nof phase relationship between the solar insolation received by the \\ntwo. \\nvii. The grid level analysis brought out that in the Arctic, a significant \\nnegative trend up to 15% per year is observed in the Chukchi and \\nEast Siberian seas in the summer minimum extent of sea ice cover.  \\nHowever, a negative trend in the winter-maximum is observed in \\nBarents Sea, which is a distinct pattern.  The positive trend in the \\nBering Sea and a negative trend in Okhotsk Sea are also visible in the \\nwinter-maximum image.  In contrast to the dominant negative trend \\nin the Arctic, a mix of positive and negative trends is visible in different \\nregions of the Antarctic during the southern summer. \\nviii. A weak negative trend is visible during the months of May and June \\nin the Arctic. However, positive trend in the months of February and \\nSeptember is a distinct pattern. In case of the Antarctic, a statistically \\nsignificant positive trend during January to April (end of summer to \\nthe beginning of the winter) is an interesting outcome of the present \\nanalysis. \\nix. An interesting observation (from space) is the recent (2008-2009) \\nincrease in SIE over both the hemispheres. The decrease observed in \\nprevious 3 years has recovered in a single year. This emphasizes the \\nneed of close monitoring of the hemispheric sea ice extent in the \\nfuture years.'),\n",

The decrease in the Arctic summer ice cover, particularly \\nevident in the western Arctic, is a strong indication of changing climate \\nconditions. Over the past several decades, numerous  studies have \\ndocumented decreasing trends in sea-ice characteristics such as the ice \\nextent, area, age, and thickness (e.g., Belchansky et al., 2004; Comiso, 2002; \\nMeier, 2005; Rigor and Wallance, 2004; Stroeve et al., 2005).  \\nThe present atlas also shows significant changes in sea ice cover in various \\nparts of the Arctic and the Antarctic observed in the recent decade (1999-2009), \\nthat confirm the continuation of the previous trend of sea ice decline till 2007. \\nThe large export of freshwater and sea ice during summer could increase the \\nsalinity of the upper ocean and lead to development of the mixed layer \\nsuppression of sea-ice growth during the subsequent winter (Inoue and \\nKikuchi, 2007). Although the exact mechanisms responsible for this sea ice \\ndecline are not fully understood, recent evidence suggests that combinations \\nof oceanic and atmospheric conditions are driving the observed changes (e.g., \\nMaslanik et al., 2007; Shimada et al., 2006). The anomalies in the sea ice \\nseasonality, concentration and thickness distribution have again implications \\non oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and their role, as a climate change \\nindicator which need to be pursued further. \\n Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is having a long term plan \\nfor monitoring the climate through its satellite missions. The Oceansat-2 \\nsatellite launch by ISRO in September 2009 carries a Ku-band scatterometer'),\n",

Generally, this region lies at high altitudes near the origin of the \\nglacier. \\nALBEDO:  A quantity (non-dimensional as well as unit-less)  describing the ability of a \\nsurface to reflect solar radiation; fractional value within 0 to 1. Perfect absorber has \\nalbedo of 0 while a perfect reflector has a value of 1. \\nANTARCTIC CONVERGENCE:  Also known as the Antarctic Polar Front, it is a \\npermanent feature of circumpolar strip of sea aroun d the southernmost point of \\nthe Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, extending between 48° and 61° S; sea \\nsurface temperature decreases by about 2-3° C around this belt. \\nANTARCTIC CIRCUMPOLAR CURRENT:  The only ocean current flowing around the \\nglobe; flows from west to east thereby, getting the name West Wind Drift. \\nARCTIC OCEAN: Ocean in the North Polar region located north of t he Arctic Circle \\n(66.5° N), considered to be the smallest of the five major world oceans. \\nBACKSCATTERING COEFFICIENT:  Also known as the normalized radar cross \\nsection, it gives the average reflectivity of ground cell per unit area \\nBLIZZARD: A cold storm having wind speed of more than 56 km/ hr and temperature \\nless than -6.7°C. The strong winds carries snow fro m the ground taking it around \\nand the visibility becomes very poor. \\nBRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURE:  Temperature of a blackbody, in thermal equilibrium  \\nwith its surrounding that would be needed to radiat e the same intensity of a gray \\nbody at a given wavelength.  \\nBRINE:  Water saturated with salt, as in seawater. \\nCRYOSPHERE:   A word used to include all the frozen places of t he earth where water \\nis found in its solid phase. Sea ice, glaciers, ice caps, permafrost etc are included. \\nDOWNWELLING:   Sinking of surface water due to increased density; arises either due \\nto change in temperature or increase in salinity.
